# SentinelPay Security Documentation

This document outlines the security features and practices implemented in the SentinelPay banking API system.

## Security Architecture

SentinelPay implements a defense-in-depth security strategy with multiple layers of protection:

### Authentication & Authorization

#### User Authentication
- **Multi-factor Authentication**
  - Password-based primary authentication
  - Time-based one-time password (TOTP) as second factor
  - Support for biometric authentication through client applications

- **Session Management**
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with short expiration (1 hour default)
  - Secure refresh token rotation
  - Token blacklisting for immediate revocation
  - Redis-based token storage

- **Password Security**
  - Bcrypt password hashing with salt rounds configurable in environment
  - Password strength requirements (minimum length, complexity)
  - Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
  - Secure password reset flow with time-limited tokens

#### Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - User roles: user, manager, admin
  - Granular permission checks in middleware
  - Resource ownership validation

- **API Authentication**
  - Bearer token authentication for user sessions
  - API key authentication for service-to-service communication

### Data Protection

#### Encryption
- **Data at Rest**
  - Sensitive personal information encrypted in database
  - Encryption keys managed securely
  - Two-factor secrets stored encrypted

- **Data in Transit**
  - All API communications over TLS
  - Modern cipher suites and protocols
  - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

#### Data Handling
- **Sensitive Data**
  - PII minimization principles applied
  - Account numbers and other sensitive data masked in responses
  - Credit card data never stored

- **Data Validation**
  - Strict schema validation for all inputs
  - Data sanitization to prevent injection attacks
  - Input length and format restrictions

### Transaction Security

#### Transaction Integrity
- **ACID Compliance**
  - Atomic transactions with rollback capability
  - Mongoose transactions for consistency
  - Proper error handling and recovery

- **Non-repudiation**
  - Digital signing of transaction receipts
  - Comprehensive audit logs of all actions
  - Transaction references and hashes

#### Fraud Prevention
- **Real-time Monitoring**
  - ML-based transaction risk scoring
  - Unusual activity detection
  - Velocity checks and pattern recognition

- **Device Trust**
  - Device fingerprinting
  - Trusted device management
  - Location-based risk assessment

### Infrastructure Security

#### API Protection
- **Rate Limiting**
  - Per-endpoint rate limits
  - IP-based throttling
  - Graduated response to abuse

- **Request Filtering**
  - Content security policy
  - XSS protection
  - MongoDB query injection prevention

#### System Hardening
- **Security Headers**
  - Helmet middleware implementation
  - CORS protection
  - Clickjacking prevention

- **Dependency Security**
  - Regular dependency updates
  - Vulnerability scanning
  - Minimal dependency approach

## Security Controls

### Preventive Controls

1. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs validated and sanitized
   - Schema validation with Express-validator
   - Content type checking

2. **Access Controls**
   - Middleware-based permission checks
   - Resource ownership validation
   - Principle of least privilege

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Configurable per-endpoint limits
   - Exponential backoff for repeated failures
   - IP-based blocking after threshold

### Detective Controls

1. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - Comprehensive logging of security events
   - Transaction monitoring
   - Authentication failure tracking
   - Suspicious activity alerts

2. **Audit Trail**
   - All user and administrative actions logged
   - Immutable audit records
   - Timestamps and actor identification

3. **Fraud Detection**
   - Real-time transaction analysis
   - Machine learning-based anomaly detection
   - Pattern recognition for fraud schemes

### Responsive Controls

1. **Incident Response**
   - Automated account freezing for suspicious activity
   - Transaction reversal capabilities
   - Security alert system

2. **Account Recovery**
   - Secure account recovery workflows
   - Identity verification procedures
   - Phased restoration of access

## Security Procedures

### User Security

1. **Account Creation**
   - Email verification required
   - Strong password enforcement
   - Option for immediate 2FA setup

2. **Login Process**
   - Brute force protection
   - IP-based risk assessment
   - Device fingerprinting
   - Step-up authentication for risky logins

3. **Session Management**
   - Auto-logout after inactivity
   - Concurrent session management
   - Session invalidation on password change

### Transaction Security

1. **Transaction Authorization**
   - Balance verification before processing
   - Fraud risk assessment
   - Additional verification for high-risk transactions

2. **Dispute Resolution**
   - Transaction reversal capabilities
   - Audit trail for disputes
   - Fraud case management

### Administrative Security

1. **Admin Access**
   - Strict role-based permissions
   - Enhanced authentication requirements
   - IP restrictions for administrative functions

2. **System Maintenance**
   - Secure backup procedures
   - Scheduled vulnerability scanning
   - Dependency updates and patching

## Compliance Considerations

SentinelPay is designed with the following compliance requirements in mind:

1. **Data Protection**
   - GDPR-compliant data handling
   - Data minimization principles
   - Right to access and erasure support

2. **Financial Regulations**
   - Anti-money laundering (AML) capabilities
   - Know Your Customer (KYC) integration points
   - Regulatory reporting support

3. **Industry Standards**
   - OWASP security best practices
   - PCI DSS considerations for payment handling
   - SOC 2 compliance controls

## Security Testing

The following security testing is recommended for SentinelPay implementations:

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - API security testing

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Penetration testing
   - Code reviews
   - Security architecture reviews

## Security Recommendations for Deployment

When deploying SentinelPay, consider the following security recommendations:

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use environment-specific .env files
   - Store secrets in a secure vault
   - Use different keys for development and production

2. **Network Security**
   - Deploy behind a WAF (Web Application Firewall)
   - Use private networks for database connections
   - Implement network segmentation

3. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Set up real-time security alerts
   - Monitor for unusual access patterns
   - Implement automated responses to attacks
