# Machine Learning Implementation in SentinelPay

This document describes the machine learning models and algorithms used in the SentinelPay fraud detection system.

## Overview

SentinelPay uses a combination of rule-based systems and machine learning models to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. The ML implementation focuses on anomaly detection, pattern recognition, and risk scoring to identify potentially fraudulent activities.

## Model Architecture

### Fraud Detection Model

The primary ML model is a binary classification model that predicts whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent. It uses a neural network architecture implemented with TensorFlow.js.

#### Network Architecture

```
Input Layer: 23 features
Hidden Layer 1: 64 neurons, ReLU activation, dropout (0.2)
Hidden Layer 2: 32 neurons, ReLU activation, dropout (0.2)
Hidden Layer 3: 16 neurons, ReLU activation
Output Layer: 1 neuron, Sigmoid activation (probability of fraud)
```

#### Features

The model uses the following features:

1. **Transaction-specific features**
   - Normalized transaction amount
   - Transaction type (one-hot encoded)
   - Time of day (normalized)
   - Day of week
   - Is weekend (binary)
   - Is business hours (binary)

2. **Account-specific features**
   - Account type (one-hot encoded)
   - Normalized account balance
   - Account age (days since creation)
   - Is new account (binary)

3. **User behavior features**
   - Transaction velocity (transactions per day)
   - Transaction count (last 30 days)
   - Average transaction amount
   - Standard deviation of transaction amounts
   - Ratio of current amount to average amount

4. **Pattern-based features**
   - Transaction type frequency
   - Recent failed transaction count
   - Unusual amount flag

## Training Process

The model is trained using historical transaction data with known fraud status. The training process follows these steps:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather completed transactions from the past 6 months
   - Include transactions marked as fraudulent (from fraud cases)

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Extract features from transactions
   - Normalize numerical features
   - Convert categorical features to one-hot encoding
   - Split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets

3. **Model Training**
   - Use binary cross-entropy loss function
   - Adam optimizer with learning rate of 0.001
   - 50 training epochs
   - Early stopping based on validation loss
   - Batch size of 32

4. **Evaluation**
   - Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
   - Generate ROC curve and calculate AUC
   - Test against a holdout set of recent transactions

## Prediction Pipeline

When a new transaction is submitted, the following process occurs:

1. **Feature Extraction**
   - Extract the same features used during training
   - Normalize features using the same scaling factors

2. **Basic Rule Checks**
   - Apply simple rule-based checks
   - Check for unusual amounts, locations, times
   - Check for multiple failed transactions
   - Check for suspicious patterns

3. **ML Model Prediction**
   - Pass features to the trained model
   - Get fraud probability score (0-1)

4. **Score Combination**
   - Combine rule-based score (40%) and ML score (60%)
   - Generate final risk score

5. **Decision Making**
   - Transactions with score > threshold (default: 0.75) flagged for review
   - High-risk transactions (score > 0.9) trigger immediate alerts
   - Normal transactions proceed without delay

## Continuous Improvement

The fraud detection system includes mechanisms for continuous improvement:

1. **Scheduled Retraining**
   - Models are retrained weekly with new transaction data
   - Training data includes resolved fraud cases for better learning

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Model accuracy and performance metrics are tracked over time
   - False positives and false negatives are analyzed

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - New features are developed based on emerging fraud patterns
   - Feature importance is analyzed to focus on most predictive indicators

4. **Human Feedback Loop**
   - Fraud analysts review cases and provide feedback
   - Confirmed fraud cases strengthen the training data
   - False alerts are used to reduce similar false positives

## Deployment Strategy

The ML models are deployed within the application using TensorFlow.js for Node.js:

1. **Model Serving**
   - Models are loaded at application startup
   - Multiple model versions can be maintained
   - Model switching is seamless for version updates

2. **Inference Optimization**
   - Batch prediction for scheduled scans
   - Individual real-time prediction for transactions
   - Result caching to prevent duplicate analysis

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - If ML prediction fails, fall back to rule-based system
   - Default risk scores for new accounts or insufficient data

## Ethical Considerations

The fraud detection system is designed with ethical considerations in mind:

1. **Fairness and Bias**
   - Regular audits to ensure the system doesn't discriminate
   - Balanced training data across different user segments
   - Monitoring for bias in false positive rates

2. **Transparency**
   - Fraud alerts include explanation of key factors
   - Users can request information about decisions
   - Documentation of the decision-making process

3. **Privacy**
   - Personal data is minimized in model training
   - Features are abstracted to avoid direct use of PII
   - Compliance with data protection regulations

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the ML system include:

1. **Advanced Models**
   - Ensemble methods combining multiple models
   - Recurrent neural networks for sequence analysis
   - Unsupervised anomaly detection

2. **Additional Data Sources**
   - Device fingerprinting
   - Behavioral biometrics
   - Network analysis for fraud rings

3. **Real-time Learning**
   - Online learning for immediate pattern adaptation
   - A/B testing of model variations
   - Active learning for ambiguous cases
